Sentiment Analysis, as the name suggests, it means to identify the view or emotion behind a situation. It basically means to analyze and find the emotion or intent behind a piece of text or speech or any mode of communication.
We, humans communicate with each other in a variety of languages and any language is just a mediator or a way in which we try to express ourselves. And whatever we say has a sentiment associated with it. It might be positive or negative or it might be neutral as well.

### Example: 
There is a fast-food chain company and they sell a variety of different food items like burgers, pizza, sandwiches, milkshakes, etc. They have created a website to sell their food and now the customers can order any food item from their website and they can provide reviews as well, like whether they liked the food or hated it.

- User Review 1: I love this cheese sandwich, it’s so delicious.
- User Review 2: This chicken burger has a very bad taste.
- User Review 3: I ordered this pizza today.

So, as we can see that above 3 reviews, 
> #### The first review is definitely a positive one and it signifies that the customer was really happy with the sandwich.

> #### The second review is negative, and hence the company needs to look into their burger department.
> #### And, the third one doesn’t signify whether that customer is happy or not, and hence we can consider this as a neutral statement.
